title: "Is Manual Transmission More Fuel Efficient Than Automatic Transmission?"
output: github_document
---

Data for 32 1973-74 model US automobiles are analysed to determine whether manual or automatic transmission is more fuel efficient, and to determine the best precitors for fuel efficiency. I use regression methods - linear regression, multivariate regression and nested likelihood tests to find that at fixed automobile weight, there is no difference in fuel efficiency between vehicles with manual and automatic transmission. Fuel efficiency is principally determined by automobile weight and the number of cylinders.

It is important to note that these conclusions apply only for this particular set of automobiles i.e. 1973-74 model US automobiles, and are not necessarily applicable to all models of automobiles at all times.
